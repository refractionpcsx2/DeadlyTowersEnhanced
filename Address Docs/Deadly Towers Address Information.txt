Things of note regarding knockback:
$8E76 has a call to $8EBB which forces the knockback when you're in the "hit" state. But something else reverses your facing direction
$9544 forces the projectile direction
$9343 forces player to look in opposite direction (as if going backwards)

To get rid of knockback, need to NOP the following:
$8E76 was BNE $8EBB
$9544 was BNE $957A
$9343 was BNE $9352

// This clears the I Frame Timer back to zero, which screws up the new room I Frames if enabled
$D208 was   STA $A2 now NOP NOP (EA EA) same address in HXD + 10

New Function for IFrame on entry applied to new room function (goes in to memory around $8130 replacing the first JSR of the function):

A9 01   // LDA #$01
85 A2   //  STA IFrameTimer
20 B7 FE // JSR $FEB7
60       // RTS


Making the music not loop:

// Checks is the new music is the same as the old one, if so doesn't tell the music to change.
Block1: put at end of PRG
CD FF 02  // CMP $2FF
F0 03    // BEQ 3 Bytes
8D E3 07  //STA $07E3  // Store new value if the song changed
60       // RTS

// Keeps track of the current music track in $2FF
Block2: put at end of PRG
BC E3 07 // LDY with $07E3
18 	 // CLC
C0 10    // CPY 10
90 03    // If Less than 10 skip
8C FF 02 // STY in $2FF
A9 FF    // LDA $#FF
9D E3 07  // STA in $07E3
60  // RTS


85AF was STA $07E3 replace this with other JSR call JSR Block1

C9B0 was LDA #$FF replace this with JSR call to Block2


Bugs in original code:
- $04A9 says which projectile is going to be fired next (default to 0 for first), if you have double shot, if you're fast you can fire off a single shot and this gets flipped to 1, 
      if you fire again while the first projectile is still on the screen, it behaves normally and resets to 0, but if you wait until projectile 1 is gone, the next shot will fire 2 projectiles
- Agate/Orange Necklace is always active once activated due to a programming error where they don't clear the right bit or register once the effect finishes at $EF4D, it should clear $185 bit 0, not $1B5 bit 3
  the manual doesn't say it's temporary, however, so the code is just a complicated mess to give you an invisible 1 hp damage reduction regardless of the fact it has a timer.
