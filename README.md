# Deadly Towers Enhanced Edition

A small set of patches (and information) to improve the Deadly Towers NES experience and aid in rom hacking/cheats.

I spent about 24 hours messing around with the code and working out where things are, and now I have put it up for your pleasure.

Patches for the US version of the game are here, and come in 2 flavours:

1. Only sped up scene transitions and making the music not restart where it is repeating the same track.  There is still a small pause, but I can't do much about that here.
2. Sped up scene transitions, no music restart, no knockback, I frames entering new rooms.

Pick your poison and apply it to the US ROM of Deadly Towers using a tool such as Lunar IPS.

Hopefully nothing is broken ;)

Enjoy!
